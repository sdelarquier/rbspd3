I wanted to learn how to use d3.js for data visualization. I ended up learning about node.js and express.js too! And how to interface mongodb with all of these packages. So that was fun!

To run, you will need node.js >0.8 (I recommend using nvm to install node.js and npm for all packages).

Then cd into the cloned repo and type:

    node app.js

This will open a node.js served on:

    localhost:3000
    
For a preview of what this app looks like (provided the server is running):

<http://rbspd3.herokuapp.com/>

Note, this works best in Google Chrome.

Enjoy!
